# Weather App UI - Swift

## Overview
This project is a Weather App user interface (UI) designed in Swift. The app provides a visually appealing and intuitive screen layout for displaying weather information. While it does not pull real-time data, it serves as a prototype or template for a fully functional weather app.

## Features
- **Modern Design:** A clean and user-friendly interface that displays essential weather information.
- **Temperature Display:** Sections for showing the current temperature.
- **Weather Icons:** Visual representations of weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) to enhance user experience.
- **Location Header:** Space allocated to display the city or location for which the weather data applies.
- **Daily Forecast:** A section designed to show a 5-day forecast with temperatures and weather conditions.

## Development
- **Swift:** The primary programming language used to develop the UI, ensuring smooth and efficient performance.
- **UIKit:** Leveraged to create the various interface elements and ensure they are responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
- **Storyboard/Xcode:** Used for designing the UI visually, allowing for easy adjustments and fine-tuning of the layout.

## Usage
- **Prototyping:** This UI can be used as a foundation for building a fully functional weather app by integrating real-time data from weather APIs.
- **Learning Resource:** Ideal for developers learning Swift and iOS app design, providing a practical example of creating a weather app interface.
